         <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>Bruschetta (pronounced brew-SKET-tah) is an Italian appetizer or antipasti that starts with a base of toasted or grilled bread. The bread is then served warm either with a topping spooned over or with a topping on the side so each person can build their own bruschetta. Bruschetta is meant to be served as a hand-held finger food, large enough for one or two bites.</p>
         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>2 to 3 tomatoes (note that tomatoes must be ripe and fresh)</li>
            <li>1 clove of minced garlic</li>
            <li>Â¼ bowl of olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Balsamic Vinegar</li>
            <li>1 pinch of thyme (optional)</li>
            <li>A little salt</li>
            <li>A little pepper</li>
            <li>1 baguette</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
            <li><strong>Peel the tomato</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>An easy way to peel tomatoes is to briefly boil them.</li>
                    <li>Cut an X on the bottom of the tomato, this will help you peel them more conveniently.</li>
                    <li>Note, tomatoes are only allowed to boil briefly, that is, when the water is boiling, turn off the heat and put the tomatoes in for 1-2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>If you still want to try it longer, maybe the broth will turn into tomato soup.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Heat the oven</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Turn on the double-sided oven at 230 C degree</li>
                    <li>The oven without oil does not need to be turned on first</li>
                    <li>If using a pan, you should also turn on the stove to heat the pan</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Diced tomatoes</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Mixed composite</strong>
                <p>
                    Mix tomatoes, salt, a little olive oil (1-2 tablespoons), pepper, Balsamic vinegar, garlic as the ratio above. Once the mixture is done, set them aside.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Slice the bread and pop them in the oven</strong>
                <p>
                    Slice the bread to a thickness of about 2-4 cm. Then spread olive oil on both sides of the bread and prepare to put it in the oven. The temperature here fluctuates between 200-210 degrees Celsius. If you decide to pan-fry, try to make the bread reach a certain golden and crispy.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Mixture moves onto the bread</strong>
                <p>
                    This step is the last step before the dish is finished. However, I recommend that you re-steam the mixture and reduce the seasoning to make the dish best for you.</p>
            </li>
